Hello, this project is created by Germano D'Costa

The project was created on IntelliJ IDE.
In order to run this project you have to add SQLite JDBC driver as a module to the project.
The driver is provided in the lib folder inside the Project main folder.

By default there is an SQLite database provided in the database folder of the Project.
If you want to create and use a completely new database, move the already existing SQLite out of the database folder andre run the project.
By doing so the program will create a new database similar to the old database but without any data in it.
